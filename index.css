  then we set the height and width of it to be half of that, which makes area 1/4 of 4 cells, = 1 cell
  then we center it within its space horizontally and vetically
  WARNING: Using these justify and align properties will stop grid from automatically expanding an element to fill the entire cell.
  if it has one word the size will be only to fit that one word
  that is not happening here only because i do height and width 50% 50%
